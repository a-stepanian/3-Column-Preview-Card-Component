## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow - coded the mobile layout first and used the media query for the desktop version.

### What I learned
- Time estimating - This is the first time I estimated how long it would take to build out a component.  It took just over an hour and I estimated it would take about an hour an a half.  I assumed there would be more things I would need to research to complete the task but most of the features of this componenent were actually straight forward and didn't require any additional research.  With the exception of...
- overflow: hidden will prevent child elements from overriding the parent element's border radius.  This definitely made styling much simpler and would have been useful on the last assignment.
